# Creative Universe
A central repository of anonymously submitted ideas about anything and everything.

## What's the point? 
Throw your idea into a "universe" of other open source ideas. Let someone else make it a reality.

## To Run

Ensure Python 2.7 and Flask are installed. More about running Flask can be found here: http://flask.pocoo.org/

Once you have a flask virtual environment activated, run the following command:
```python app.py```
